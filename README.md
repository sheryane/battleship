Classic Battleship game with computer as 2nd player, made during Java classes.

We used some design patterns:
- Builder;
- Observer;
- Delegation.

Also we wrote the part of the code using TDD.

Everyone had a chance and time to work by himself on each task. Each step was checked with teacher and validated by him.
Once I finished, my code compiled flawlessly on first run.
